# NodeJS - File System Exercise

**Goal:** Serve an image through an API route using NodeJS and TypeScript.

## Instructions

1. Create a `dev` branch after accepting the assignment.
2. Set up your web server in Node.js and import the necessary modules such as `http`, `fs`, and `path` into your `server.ts` file.
3. Create a route for `/view-image` that will show the image `veryhappydog.jpg` to the user when the route is opened in the browser. For example: http://localhost:3000/view-image
4. Make sure the response Content-Type is set to `image/jpeg`.
5. Compile your `src/server.ts` to `dist/server.js` and run the server with `node dist/server.js`.
6. Commit and push you changes once you are done. Create a PR and merge your dev branch to your main branch.
